# Circuit Rush

## Overview
Circuit Rush is a 3D racing game where players control a car to navigate through a circuit, avoiding obstacles and aiming for the best time. The game leverages Three.js for rendering 3D graphics and Cannon.js for physics simulation.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **Cannon.js**: For physics simulation.
- **GSAP**: For animations.
- **Lodash**: For utility functions.
- **Vite**: For development and build tooling.

## Three.js Concepts
- **Scene**: The 3D space where all objects are placed.
- **Camera**: Defines the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.
- **Geometry**: Defines the shape of 3D objects.
- **Material**: Defines the appearance of 3D objects.
- **Mesh**: Combines geometry and material to create a 3D object.
- **Lighting**: Adds light sources to the scene to illuminate objects.
- **Animation**: Animates objects within the scene.
- **Physics**: Simulates physical interactions between objects.
